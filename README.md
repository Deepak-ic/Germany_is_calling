### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to automate the login functionality testing of the "**Germany is Calling**" web application using Selenium WebDriver with Java. The following tests are included:

1. **Test 1: Successful Login** - Verifies that a user can log in successfully with valid credentials.
2. **Test 2: Unsuccessful Login** - Verifies that an error message is displayed when incorrect credentials are used.

### Test Execution Steps

### Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure that you have the following software installed on your machine:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above**: Required to run Java applications.
- **Apache Maven**: For managing dependencies and running test scripts.
- **IDE (e.g., Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA)**: Recommended for viewing and editing the test scripts.
- **WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver)**: Download and configure the WebDriver for your browser.
- **TestNG**: Test framework for writing and executing the tests.

### Project Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/Deepak-ic/Germany_is_calling.git]

2. **Import the Project into Your IDE**:

 -  Open your IDE (Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA).
 -  Import the project as a Maven project: **File** -> **Import** -> **Maven** -> **Existing Maven Projects**.
 -  Select the cloned repository directory.

3. **Configure**:
   
 -  There is nothing to configure just import and run.

### Running the Tests

1. **Run Tests**
   
 - Right-click on **AppGermany** located in the **src/test/java directory**.
 - Select **Run As** -> **TestNG Test**.

2. **View Test Report**:

 - After running the tests, you can find the test report in the **test-output** directory generated by TestNG.
 - Open **test-output/index.html** in a web browser to view the report.

#### Assumptions

 - **Valid Test Credentials**: It is assumed that valid credentials are available for testing successful login scenarios.
 - **Stable Internet Connection**: Required for accessing the "Germany is Calling" web application.
 - **Environment Configuration**: Assumes the environment is set up correctly with all necessary dependencies and tools installed.

### Additional Information

### Challenge Faced

 - **Handling Asynchronous Elements**: Used WebDriverWait to handle dynamic and asynchronous elements on the login page.
 - **Error Message Verification**: Verifying specific error messages based on UI changes was challenging.

### Potential Improvements

 - **Page Object Model (POM) Pattern**: Refactor code to use the POM pattern for better maintainability and readability.
 - **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate with CI/CD tools like Jenkins for continuous testing.

### Limitations

 - **Browser Compatibility**: The current test scripts are configured for Chrome. Additional configurations are needed for Firefox, Safari, etc.
